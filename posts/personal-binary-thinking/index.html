                <p>I&#39;ve been reflecting on the persistence of binary thinking in right wing ideology and the danger it poses to society. </p>
<p>This thinking is endemic to our politics and shapes much of how we are taught to perceive the world. It&#39;s most plainly displayed when it comes to crime which is so rigidly tied to morality. Right wing ideology frames crime as a battle between righteous people who rigidly and obediently follow the law and sinners. The reality is much more nuanced. Laws are shaped and enforced to the advantage of the people who write them, mainly rich, white, men. Before 1991 and <em>R v R</em> the precedent was a man could legally rape his wife. This is a clear case of morality being out of step with legality. The same could apply to recreational drug use, illegal forms of protest, the right to roam.</p>
<p>This use of Christian theology to legitimise binary thinking is particularly insidious. It excuses the worst of society &quot;<em>What man is perfect?</em>&quot; whilst demonising those who seek any institutional change. It allows for the organised dismissal of any challenge to power. You are a sinner and therefore cannot speak before others about what is moral. Injustice goes unquestioned and unpunished. </p>
<p>&quot;<em>Let he without sin cast the first stone.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Binary thinking works as a mechanism to shut down alternatives to the status quo. To incite fear and dismissal of new ideas. To say that, things aren&#39;t perfect, but they are what&#39;s standing between us and chaos. There are police or there is barbarism. There is unrestrained capitalism or there is authoritarian communism. There is this imperfect world or there is heaven, or hell.</p>
<p>As creatives, we have the choice, the tools and the responsibility to present nuance and spectrum. This is not the same as being neutral. It&#39;s shining a light on the centre of the Venn diagram or the parts that fall outside it. It&#39;s showing contradiction and intersection. </p>
