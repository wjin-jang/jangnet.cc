                <p>I saw N.Flying at the O2 and it was amazing!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know who N.Flying are, that&#39;s completely reasonable... ^^&#39; They&#39;re not very popular outside Korea and not even that popular within Korea with 386k monthly listeners on Spotify. Hardly comparable to BTS&#39; 25.2M monthly listeners or even NCT 127&#39;s 2.5M. But their music is really good!</p>

<p>I discovered N.Flying through their single &#39;Rooftop&#39;. It is, deservedly, their most popular song because it absolutely slaps. I really liked their 2021 album &#39;Man on the Moon&#39; so I was super hyped to see them live.</p>

<p>All the members are individually incredibly talented and their setlist gave a lot of opportunities for everyone to shine. I was super impressed with Jae-hyun&#39;s drumming, Seung-hyub&#39;s rapping and Hwe-seung&#39;s vocals (he really hit some crazy high notes!!)</p>

<p>This was my first ever big concert experience. I&#39;ve been to a few live music events at pubs and a couple musicals when I was young but never a real &#39;concert&#39; concert. I have to say now that I&#39;ve been to one, I see the hype. It&#39;s really amazing the immersion and the atmosphere, especially at the indigo.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll definitely be trying to go to more concerts in the future. I just need to figure out this whole &#39;ticket price&#39; thing first.</p>
<p>Go stream N.Flying if you haven&#39;t already!</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: I was also really impressed by the translator. Live translation is super hard and she did a really great job!!</em></p>
