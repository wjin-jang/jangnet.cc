                <p>I saw N.Flying at the O2 and it was amazing!</p>

                <p>If you don't know who N.Flying are, that's completely reasonable... ^^' They're not very popular outside Korea and not even that popular within Korea with 386k monthly listeners on Spotify. Hardly comparable to BTS' 25.2M monthly listeners or even NCT 127's 2.5M. But their music is really good!</p>

                <p>I discovered N.Flying through their single 'Rooftop'. It is, deservedly, their most popular song because it absolutely slaps. I really liked their 2021 album 'Man on the Moon' so I was super hyped to see them live.</p>

                <p>All the members are individually incredibly talented and their setlist gave a lot of opportunities for everyone to shine. I was super impressed with Jae-hyun's drumming, Seung-hyub's rapping and Hwe-seung's vocals (he really hit some crazy high notes!!)</p>

                <p>This was my first ever big concert experience. I've been to a few live music events at pubs and a couple musicals when I was young but never a real 'concert' concert. I have to say now that I've been to one, I see the hype. It's really amazing the immersion and the atmosphere, especially at the indigo.</p>

                <p>I'll definitely be trying to go to more concerts in the future. I just need to figure out this whole 'ticket price' thing first.</p>
                <p>Go stream N.Flying if you haven't already!</p>
                <p><em>Sidenote: I was also really impressed by the translator. Live translation is super hard and she did a really great job!!</em></p>
